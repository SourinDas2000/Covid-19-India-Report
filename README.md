# About The Code
The program fetches data from a CSV file containing various details about COVID-19 in India. It plots three graphs showing the confirmed cases, death toll, and total patients cured in four of the major states which were mostly effected by the pandemic; from 2020 to 2021. The four states are: Maharashtra, Kerela, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. 

There is a fourth graph which is a bar graph, showing the report of the entire country and not just a state.
